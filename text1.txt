Solve merging conflict

git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge branch_name
git push origin master

If error occurs, check gitHub. If not possible to solve issue there, then use procedure described above to operate from terminal. Then, check the local repository and open/edit each file by removing error messages.


“If I have a local branch from a remote one, I don't feel comfortable with merging other branches than this one with the remote. Also I would not push my changes, until I'm happy with what I want to push and also I wouldn't push things at all, that are only for me and my local repository. In your description it seems, that test is only for you? So no reason to publish it.”
